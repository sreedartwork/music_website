# music_website
Mock Artist website
This project was based on a music artist tour website on the Coding Phase platform.
I also used the Dev Starter Kit from Coding Phase Github.
This helped speed up the process of the gulp task manager for compiling to production 
and browser-sync for auto-reload for development.
I had to hand-code some of the media queries which lead to some trial 
and error testing also, the I-frame for the moving header was interesting to learn.
